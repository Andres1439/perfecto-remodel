            In contemporary construction, masonry has evolved from traditional load-bearing walls to engineered structural systems. From hand-laid
            brick patterns to prefabricated stone panels, modern masonry combines material science with precision craftsmanship for durable and
            aesthetically striking buildings.
          </p>

          <p>
            The foundation of quality masonry lies in proper mortar mixing, joint reinforcement, and structural bonding patterns. These critical
            elements ensure compressive strength while accommodating thermal expansion and seismic forces.

        <p>
          Modern masonry construction requires understanding of compressive strength calculations and lateral load resistance. Advanced techniques
          include post-tensioned brick walls, composite masonry-concrete systems, and reinforced cavity walls with integrated insulation for energy
          efficiency.
