            In modern construction, flooring systems have evolved from basic surface coverings to complex multi-layer assemblies. From traditional
            concrete subfloors to advanced floating floor systems, contemporary flooring integrates structural performance with aesthetic requirements
            while addressing acoustic and thermal challenges.
          </p>

          <p>
            The foundation of quality flooring installation lies in precise subfloor preparation, moisture mitigation, and expansion joint planning.
            These critical elements ensure dimensional stability and prevent premature wear in both residential and commercial environments.

        <p>
          Modern flooring construction requires understanding of load distribution and material compatibility. Advanced techniques include
          self-leveling underlayments, uncoupling membranes for tile installations, and engineered wood systems with integrated vapor barriers for
          below-grade applications.

          &quot;A successful floor isn&apos;t just what you see - it&apos;s the invisible layers beneath that determine its longevity and
          performance.&quot;

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Innovative Surface Technologies</h2>

        <p>
          The flooring industry now offers photocatalytic ceramic tiles, conductive flooring for static control, and modular click-lock systems with
          integrated underfloor heating. Recent advancements include antimicrobial surface treatments and digital printing technologies for
          hyper-realistic material replication.
